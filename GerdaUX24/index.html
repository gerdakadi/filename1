            <h1> My <em>first</em> time studying <strong>HTML</strong></h1>
            <p>This is my road to becoming a UX designer.</p>
            <h2>Learning HTML</h2>
            <p>How did i start learning HTML?</p>
            <p>In school, I first encountered HTML in class. Our teacher introduced us to the basics of the languageâ€”tags, elements, and how they structure web content. We started by creating simple webpages with headings, paragraphs, and links. The thrill of seeing my code come to life was exhilarating. As we progressed, I built a personal homepage, experimenting with various elements and styles. This initial exposure to HTML ignited my passion for web development and set the foundation for my future in coding.</p>
            <h2>Emotions</h2><!DOCTYPE html>
            <p>My first experience with HTML was really fun. I was really greedy when I was learning HTML, I always wanted to learn more and know how to make stuff like a nav bar or something else. I had an amazing experience with HTML.</p>
